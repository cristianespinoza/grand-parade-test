# grand-parade-test

## Task

Write a function that accepts multiple arrays of objects. Each object has a lastModified property with date (instance of Date).
 
Function should output one array that contains all objects found in the arrays, without duplicates (compared by reference), and sorted from the oldest to the newest.
 
Do not use any library, rely only on native APIs. You should use ES6 syntax. Provide some examples, or – ideally – write unit tests with your favoriute testing framework.
 
Please provide the solution in the most convenient way for you – it can be a JS Fiddle, a GitHub repository, or a Node.js script sent in a zip file.
If anything is unclear – please use common sense and document your assumptions.
